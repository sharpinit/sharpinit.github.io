					<h2 class="lg">Life Change Facilitator: My Journey to Here and Now</h2><br />
					<img class="width100" src="img/kevan.jpg" alt="Kevan smiling in a purple polo casually leaning on boulders near a river">
					<p>Everyone has a story that deserves to be shared, the story of their life! Sometimes, we find ourselves at points in the journey of life where we may ask ‘why’ that happened to me or ‘why’ am I feeling like this now. Much of my early childhood experiences involved family-related trauma on a regular basis over a prolonged period. Many of those memories were somehow blocked from immediate recollection throughout most of my early adult years.  Then, in my mid-40’s, things started to arise that caused me heightened levels of anxiety and an underlying concern that I was beginning to unravel. Repressed childhood memories of events bubbled to the surface, nightmares were recurrent, I had several mental breakdowns, and I became aware that I exhibited many classic PTSD symptoms such as hypervigilance, avoidance, nightmares, flashbacks, and severe depression.  My story, like that of so many others, is a journey of struggling to understand ‘why’, in my otherwise idyllic life at the time, I was experiencing intermittent depression and low self-esteem, periods of self-medicating, and an underlying anger that leaked into relationships on every level. Running out of options to find peace and balance, I began searching to find solutions that subsequently allowed me to make long-term life changes. Systematically, I worked to remove obstacles and achieve the life that I deserved to have, and eventually be free of the effects of PTSD and unresolved childhood issues.
					</p>
					<p class="lg centeralign l">“My first session resulted in a life changing experience.”</p>
					<p>In 2001, on the suggestion of a loving relative, I attended training workshops and became a Certified  Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) Master Practitioner.  Using the powerful techniques of NLP, I set goals in such an impactful way that those goals ‘appeared before me’ as my life progressed.   The realization of those goals has continued to occur according to a plan that I made then, and I was living through this plan.  Even “Peace of Mind” is a realized goal that I put in place in 2001.  NLP helped me in many ways to resolve the effects of the childhood trauma, but I still had a long way to go as I continued to repress uncomfortable memories and experienced frequent bouts of anger.</p>
					<p>Years later, unannounced, a deep depression set in again and became almost unmanageable.   PTSD symptoms intensified.  My physical and mental health negatively affected those around me.  I had no idea that my brain had been trained to respond to everyday stressors as life-threatening events! It didn’t make sense, and I thought I had “fixed” myself already. But the programming of those long-term childhood traumatic experiences was powerful…and stubborn. It was going to take more than a quick reboot, and I had stopped applying NLP protocols for myself.  At one point, I had an emotional crisis after an attempted suicide, and was again referred by a caring family member, this time to a PSYCK-K<sup>&reg;</sup> facilitator.  I had no knowledge of what PSYCH-K<sup>&reg;</sup> was, but I needed help and I was willing to try it out.  My first session resulted in a life changing experience. 
					</p>
					<br />
					<img class="width100" src="img/kevan2.jpg" alt="Kevan smiling in a blue long sleeve shirt flexing in nature">
					<br />
					<p>It was so easy!  I had entered the room as a broken and wounded person who was clearly severely depressed.  During the PSYCH-K<sup>&reg;</sup> processes, called balances, my body posture changed from slumping and looking down, with weak verbal communication to one who emanated light from within, erect body posture and a voice of confidence.  Everyone who witnessed the session was amazed at how 30 minutes of PSYCH-K<sup>&reg;</sup> balances had resulted in an extremely miraculous transformation.    I felt like a completely changed and better person overall as I left the PSYCH-K<sup>&reg;</sup> facilitator’s office.  Things quickly got better at work, home, and with friends. Using PSYCH-K<sup>&reg;</sup> I have continued to evolve to become a much better person overall. The results are such that my depression and anxiety are again manageable, and other symptoms diminished tremendously.  I am a believer in what PSYCH-K<sup>&reg;</sup> continues to do for me and others.
					</p>
					<p>With such a profound change, I became a trained facilitator and have taken all the significant workshops that are offered in PSYCH-K<sup>&reg;</sup>.  Many of my friends and family have witnessed these changes and have commented that they can see that I am a different person. I am happier, laugh more, and am much easier to get along with. 
					</p>
					<p>Over the years of training and application, I have experienced and witnessed how the benefits of PSYCH-K<sup>&reg;</sup> are far-reaching and almost infinite.  Whatever the issue, a PSYCH-K<sup>&reg;</sup> processes can be employed to alleviate the issues one is experiencing. While PSYCH-K&reg; and NLP cannot alter the experiences of the past, they absolutely serve to change the way in which we perceive that past, the ways the past can negatively impact the present, and work at the deepest levels to create lasting, positive changes in our lives.
					</p>
					<p>Through this time, I also became certified as a life and executive coach.  Coaching, PSYCH-K<sup>&reg;</sup> and NLP work well together for the various needs or concerns someone might have.   Whether it be NLP, PSYCH-K<sup>&reg;</sup> or coaching, I am in the right place to be able to focus on helping others in the many modalities I have been trained to use. That’s a part of my story and I would enjoy an opportunity to hear yours.
