					<h1 class="lg">What is Executive and Life Coaching?</h1>
					<p>Coaching is a process where the client works with a professional trained to help them to intentionally achieve what they want out of life.  Certified coaches follow professional guidelines for ethics and code of conduct. The focus of the coaching process is to guide a client to achieve the goals that have been set.  It may require understanding of obstacles that have been preventing the client from achieving their goals on their own.  Working with the coach, the client creates SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time Bound).  The client will work with the coach to develop goals and processes to achieve the goals.  Coaching uses the concept of interconnections of thoughts, feelings and actions.  Coaching helps clients achieve goals, build skills, increase confidence, and take conscious control of their lives.
					</p>
					<p>Coaching is built on the framework of the belief that every individual has the innate ability to conceptualize and bring to light the right answers for any given situation in their lives. It is the coach’s position to assist the client in locating the internal information that will bring about powerful changes to ultimately modify the client’s life in the areas where change is desired.

					<p class="white">The operating principles of coaching are:
					</p>
					<ul class="white">
						<li>Maintaining a commitment to supporting the client.</li>
						<li>Build the coaching relationship on truth, openness, and trust.</li>
						<li>The client is responsible for the results they are generating.</li>
						<li>The client is capable of much better results than they are currently generating.</li>
						<li>Focus on what the client thinks and experiences.</li>
						<li>Clients can generate their own perfect solutions.</li>
						<li>The coaching conversation is based on equality.</li>

					<p>The foundational element of coaching certification is called “Life Coach.”  Under the life coach practice, the coach and client work through a variety of topics that the client feels they are not getting what they want out of life.  It could be regarding employment, relationships, career, life changes, work/life balance, and any number of topics that occur in one’s life.  When one is struggling to get what they want, often, a coach can be extremely beneficial in helping achieve goals or overcome obstacles.  
					</p>
					<p>In the executive world, there are many topics related to relationships, business, profitability, career trajectory, and many other areas that can be leveraged with an executive coach. The executive coach can help the client gain perspective and achieve success.  My experience as an executive gives me the unique knowledge and experience to help other executives achieve their goals.
					</p>
					<p>The coaching process takes multiple sessions, and the duration of the engagement depends on the complexity and number of goals that are to be achieved.    Rarely can a coaching engagement be completed in less than a few months.  It depends on the nature of the goals and obstacles. Some goals can be achieved in relatively short amounts of time, while other large goals might take much longer.
