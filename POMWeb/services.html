					<p><b>PSYCH-K<sup>&reg;</sup></b></p>
					<p>PSYCH-K<sup>&reg;</sup> works with the subconscious and beliefs to effect physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual interconnected changes. PSYCK-K<sup>&reg;</sup> results are transformational in how we think, feel and act. It helps us to change from within. Often, self-limiting beliefs can sabotage us from getting what we want out of life. Sometimes those beliefs affect our health and well-being, relationships with others, and our overall connection to the world and how we show up. Using PSYCH-K<sup>&reg;</sup> processes, we can address those self-limiting beliefs and thus improve our general sense of well-being. Examples of application of PSYCH-K<sup>&reg;</sup> are overcoming self-doubt, improving one’s self-love, transforming perception of stress from current or past experiences, overcoming addictions, living one’s life in harmony with nature, strengthening relationships, improving self-esteem, dealing with grief or loss, and many more.</p>

					<p><b>Executive and Life Coaching</b></p>
					<p>Life coaching is about being intentional in how one wants to show up in the world.  It is useful in helping people move beyond existing to thriving and prospering.  It is a conscious process to help someone take control of their lives and have their desires fulfilled.  It works with the principles of the interconnections between thoughts, feelings, and actions. Examples of areas where coaching can help someone include career navigation, personal development, improve communication, time management, conflict resolution, strengthening relationships, improving wellness, achieving lifelong dreams, improving emotional intelligence, building skills, and increasing confidence. These are but a few examples. </p>
					<p>Executive coaching is similar but applies to those working as executives and the many areas where one may need to grow such as understanding the business culture, achieving organizational efficiency, business growth and profitability, project management, business processes, business management, and awareness of importance of relationships with peers, subordinates, and superiors, and many more.</p>
