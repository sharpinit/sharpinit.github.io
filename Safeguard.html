						<p>Create a mobile first experience that is also responsive.</p><br />

					<div class="section">
                        <p>TThere was a lot to learn from a legacy product. Who does it serve, who are the users, and who are the "super" users? With initial research, we were able to start lumping into 3 types the users the end-user, administrator, and auditor.</p><br />
						<p>Knowing these three users helped with the initial wireframe and workflow designs. For instance, we wanted to keep the part of the product for the end-user to be easy to access. They made up the majority of our users. Not only were they the majority they were the most likely to be a mix of computer knowledge versus the administrators who were more tech-savvy and comfortable dialing in on application settings.</p>

					<div class="section">
                        <p>Working closely with hardware design and being the soul designer for branding I got to make sure that the experience out of the box was above the norm.</p><br />
						<p>The hardware instructions were originally a small pamphlet. Initial testing showed that the small pamphlet was tossed aside, even thrown away at times. We wanted to make sure that our users, even as smart as they were, had a chance to review the instructions as there were important steps to follow after receiving your new machine.</p>
						<p>As easy as it could have been to finish with bigger and bolder instructions both of us on the team wanted to change the way IT professionals viewed instructions and who Dell was. We came up with a more elegant 'poster' and just a simple change had these professionals stopping in their tracks when they were earlier just tossing them aside.</p>

						<p>The user experience does not just start the first time a user logs intp the application, however that may be most of our users, it starts when Safeguard is inquired about via phone or web. We would love to change Dell’s way of selling and talking about Safeguard to create the best experience, however, we took a realistic approach and started fixing the experience when an individual receives the appliance at their door.
                        </p>
                      <p>
                      We initially were told that the users first form of contact with the product, the getting started poster, was folded and placed inside of a smaller box that the appliance sat on. We then took a prototype to a few different individuals who primarily work in databases to see how they normally received and interacted with a new appliance. To our surprise, we found that the small box of contents and poster were usually thrown aside leaving the user with many questions on how to set the appliance up. We took this data back and put the poster on top of the appliance, being the first thing they got to see after opening the box, and designed the poster based on critical steps and information necessary for the user to get started. 
                      </p>

                      <p>Dell One Identity Safeguard, or Safeguard, is an enterprise solution that securely stores and rotates the passwords for small, medium, and large businesses. Allowing any size customer the ability to secure their passwords meant that the users workflow could have many variables and solutions that needed to be played out and understood before implementation. Safeguard also brought the challenge of being an on-premise appliance that could potentially never talk to the outside world. With all of the complexities behind Safeguard we were able to get out our first version released and started working on vNext. This project includes user experience, visual, and branding design where I got to work with another UX designer (locally), and collaborated with the broader Dell UX team.
