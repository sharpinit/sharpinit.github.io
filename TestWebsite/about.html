				<h1>A little more about me.</h1>	
				<p>I am currently residing in the small rural town of Buhl /Buell/ Idaho, bringing over nine years of design experience in a wide range of industries and on multiple devices including desktop, mobile, and browser-based applications for administrators and end-users. I specialize in accessibility design and regularly attend online conferences and meetups with the International Association of Accessibility Professionals (IAAP). I strongly believe that everything can be designed to be inclusive for all and always questions what else can be done to make life for those with extra needs easier. I am dedicated to learning everything about the product, platforms, and users and so you can expect me to question "what if" and "why" as I seek to further understand and enhance the experience.
				</p>
				<p>Outside of design, I enjoy cracking jokes to make everyone laugh and smile, tinkering in the garage on one of my various vehicles, or dabbling in the kitchen on new ways to cook, grill, or smoke.
