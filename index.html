                <h1>You made it. Let me show you what I do</h1>
                <p>I love designing business applications with accessibility at the core. I focus on people who need to get their work done efficiently.</p>
                <p>I have helped teachers spend less time managing screen time and more time helping students. I have given HR teams the clarity to focus on workplace morale instead of hunting for HSA balances. There is always some task employees have to accomplish to keep the lights on, even if they do not want to do it. My goal is to make those tasks so straightforward that people can finish quickly and move on to what really matters to them.</p>
                <p>If you found me through an application, LinkedIn, or just stumbled here, welcome. Let me show you how I approach design.</p>

                        <p><strong>Professional Experience: </strong>I have spent 14 years designing business applications across industries including asset management (Dell), education (Lenovo),  communications (Zoom), healthcare (Dexcom), and accessibility testing tools (Deque). I have designed enterprise solutions for thousands of users and specialized tools for teams as small as 10, working across both mobile and desktop platforms.</p>
                        <p>My approach starts with the why. I focus on understanding the root of every problem before designing solutions. This ensures I am solving the right challenge, not just addressing symptoms</p>
                        <p>Accessibility is central to everything I build. I design inclusive experiences that work for all users because it is the right thing to do and it makes better products.</p>
                        <p><strong>Outside of work: </strong>When I am not designing, you will find me tinkering on cars and engines in the garage, cooking or smoking new foods, and trying to make my team laugh once in a while.</p>
                        <p><strong>Currently: </strong>Driving UX improvements at Deque Systems through user-centered design.</p>
